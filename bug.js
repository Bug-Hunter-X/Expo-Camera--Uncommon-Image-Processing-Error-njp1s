This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom image processing.  The error message might not be explicit, but you see unexpected behavior like a blank preview or corrupted images. The root cause often lies in improperly handling the image data after capturing. This could be due to incorrect type conversions, memory management issues, or not waiting for asynchronous operations to complete before manipulating or displaying the image.

Example (Illustrative, may vary depending on your specific setup):
```javascript
const [photo, setPhoto] = useState(null);

const takePicture = async () => {
  if (!cameraRef) return;
  try {
    const photo = await cameraRef.takePictureAsync();
    // INCORRECT: Directly using photo.uri without proper handling
    setPhoto(photo.uri); // This may cause issues!
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error taking picture:', error);
  }
};
```
